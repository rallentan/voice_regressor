Training Data:
- Looking for 10 different voice actors from diverse backgrounds
- Each voice actor records long noises of each vowel sound at each of the 4 extremes (and mid-points between them) of size and weight for 5 seconds each, maintaining pitch.
- Then each voice actor reads a script at each of the 4 extremes (and midpoints) for 25 seconds.
- Repeat the last two steps with variations in pitch.
- The recordings are divided into samples of 0.5 seconds each with overlap of 0.25 seconds. For example, the first sample starts at 0 seconds and lasts for 0.5 seconds. The second sample starts at 0.25 seconds and also lasts for 0.5 seconds.
- The samples are balanced between all labels (an even number of samples between actors, between vowels, between sizes, weights, and between long-noises and speech).
- Once a model has been found that converges, evaluate each sample for the models accuracy in predicting it. There should be many speech samples with high-loss due to pauses in speech. Mark them.
- Retrain the model without the samples that lack clear audio.
